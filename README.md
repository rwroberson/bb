# bb (Build Blog)
This is a small script that I use to automatically assemble my blog posts.
The blocks folder contains html "blocks" that can be edited individually.
Give the script a html file with the body of your post, and it automatically compiles a full html webpage.

Of course, be sure to read through the code to include your own file structure and blog information.

This is still very rough, but I've taken some inspiration from [lb](github.com/lukesmithxyz/lb).
I recommend you look to his scripts for a much more complete solution.
